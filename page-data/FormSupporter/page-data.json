He hypothesized that breathing and cough sounds could be analyzed with machine learning to detect COVID patterns. Wanting to make a positive impact, he orchestrated a clinical study with 362 patients in an esteemed university hospital.

These apps will allow for mass-scale, anonymous testing to slow the virus spread. We hope to unite people across borders in our effort to stop COVID and create a new paradigm for global collaboration.\n\nWe want to create a future where community spread of infectious diseases is greatly reduced, as the world population is empowered by smartphone apps to detect their illnesses early on.","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#3.numberQuestion":"Question #3","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#3.questionIdQ":"How is Virufy different from other groups working on similar projects?","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#3.questionIdA":"Because Virufy is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, we are able to recruit highly talented professionals as volunteers.

Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example, research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutAI.Question#2.numberQuestion":"Question #2","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutAI.Question#2.questionIdQ":"How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutAI.Question#2.questionIdA":"Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe.

For example, a crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy (AUC = 0.7)[7].

Because COVID-19 creates a unique respiratory signature in the throat and lungs, distinct from respiratory infections that produce a wet cough, it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19. Though the differences may be subtle to the human ear, AI algorithms have shown promise in classifying cough sounds to identify various respiratory diseases including pertussis, asthma, and pneumonia by using various features extracted from audio waveforms, including MFCC coefficient, pitch, spectral energy, and zero crossing. Although the cough samples from various diseases sound similar, they each have a distinguishable pattern due to small differences in audio features, which AI algorithms are able to pick up on. Beyond COVID, it has been demonstrated that AI can classify certain diagnostic breath sounds, such as wheezing and rhonchi, from smartphone audio recordings.","ourApproach.topFold.checkOutResearch":"Our papers","ourApproach.topFold.bottonClose":"Close","ourApproach.howItWorks.HowIt":"How our online Covid-19 test works","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-one.title":"1","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-one.description":"Record your cough","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-two.title":"2","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-two.description":"AI analyzes for COVID patterns","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-three.title":"3","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-three.description":"COVID risk status reported","ourApproach.howItWorks.collectedData":"Collected Data Dashboard","ourApproach.howItWorks.numberofCollected":"Number of Collected Coughs","ourApproach.howItWorks.yourCoughHelp":"Your cough helps us improve our predictive model, thus being crucial in the fight against COVID-19.
