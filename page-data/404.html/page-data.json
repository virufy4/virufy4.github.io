He hypothesized that breathing and cough sounds could be analyzed with machine learning to detect COVID patterns. Wanting to make a positive impact, he orchestrated a clinical study with 362 patients in an esteemed university hospital. The original team of Virufy, beginning with Stanford graduate AI students, expanded to volunteers from universities around the world.\n\nAs a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oneyoungworld.com/'>One Young World Japan</a> ambassador who has travelled to over a dozen countries, Amil understands the global perspective and how a smartphone-based solution can be used by people all over the world.","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#2.numberQuestion":"Question #2","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#2.questionIdQ":"What will your organization do?","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#2.questionIdA":"Virufy aims to build the world’s largest dataset of COVID cough sounds by generating a movement where millions of people collectively contribute their data to fight our common enemy, COVID.

These apps will allow for mass-scale, anonymous testing to slow the virus spread. We hope to unite people across borders in our effort to stop COVID and create a new paradigm for global collaboration.\n\nWe want to create a future where community spread of infectious diseases is greatly reduced, as the world population is empowered by smartphone apps to detect their illnesses early on.","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#3.numberQuestion":"Question #3","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#3.questionIdQ":"How is Virufy different from other groups working on similar projects?","faqstext.questionSection.questionsAboutVirufy.Question#3.questionIdA":"Because Virufy is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, we are able to recruit highly talented professionals as volunteers. Our team is global, spanning five continents, and our organization thus has global empathy built in. We are not concerned with making profit, so are able to work in developing countries. Our dense networks in Stanford and One Young World grant us access to top echelon contacts in every country of the world.

Because COVID-19 creates a unique respiratory signature in the throat and lungs, distinct from respiratory infections that produce a wet cough, it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19. Though the differences may be subtle to the human ear, AI algorithms have shown promise in classifying cough sounds to identify various respiratory diseases including pertussis, asthma, and pneumonia by using various features extracted from audio waveforms, including MFCC coefficient, pitch, spectral energy, and zero crossing. Although the cough samples from various diseases sound similar, they each have a distinguishable pattern due to small differences in audio features, which AI algorithms are able to pick up on. Beyond COVID, it has been demonstrated that AI can classify certain diagnostic breath sounds, such as wheezing and rhonchi, from smartphone audio recordings.","ourApproach.topFold.checkOutResearch":"Our papers","ourApproach.topFold.bottonClose":"Close","ourApproach.howItWorks.HowIt":"How our online Covid-19 test works","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-one.title":"1","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-one.description":"Record your cough","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-two.title":"2","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-two.description":"AI analyzes for COVID patterns","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-three.title":"3","ourApproach.howItWorks.card-three.description":"COVID risk status reported","ourApproach.howItWorks.collectedData":"Collected Data Dashboard","ourApproach.howItWorks.numberofCollected":"Number of Collected Coughs","ourApproach.howItWorks.yourCoughHelp":"Your cough helps us improve our predictive model, thus being crucial in the fight against COVID-19.
