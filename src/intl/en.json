          "questionIdA": "When the pandemic hit, Virufy’s founder, Amil, knew smartphones were omnipresent and that COVID impacted the nose, throat, and lungs. He hypothesized that breathing and cough sounds could be analyzed with machine learning to detect COVID patterns. Wanting to make a positive impact, he orchestrated a clinical study with 362 patients in an esteemed university hospital. The original team of Virufy, beginning with Stanford graduate AI students, expanded to volunteers from universities around the world.\n\nAs a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oneyoungworld.com/'>One Young World Japan</a> ambassador who has travelled to over a dozen countries, Amil understands the global perspective and how a smartphone-based solution can be used by people all over the world."

          "questionIdA": "Virufy aims to build the world’s largest dataset of COVID cough sounds by generating a movement where millions of people collectively contribute their data to fight our common enemy, COVID. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit startup free of institutional red tape and with a diverse team across 20 countries, we are well positioned to make this happen.\n\nOnce approved by local public health authorities, smartphone app(s) for rapid, no-cost COVID testing will be released in low-income countries. These apps will allow for mass-scale, anonymous testing to slow the virus spread. We hope to unite people across borders in our effort to stop COVID and create a new paradigm for global collaboration.\n\nWe want to create a future where community spread of infectious diseases is greatly reduced, as the world population is empowered by smartphone apps to detect their illnesses early on."

          "questionIdA": "More than 200 volunteers have put thousands of hours into making the project possible. Companies including Slack and JotForm have supported us with free software and cloud credits as COVID responders. Other expenses such as email services and cloud compute have been paid out of the founder Amil’s savings but are only a few thousand dollars.\n\nWe believe that if we are successful, our cloud compute costs will increase, but we will be able to attract ample grant funding and private donations, and thus are thinking to rely solely on that."

          "questionIdQ": "Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?",
          "questionIdA": "Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 damages the throat and lungs, creating detecable differences in cough patterns. Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example, research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy."

          "questionIdA": "Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences."

          "numberQuestion": "Question #3",
          "questionIdQ": "How can the app help prevent coronavirus infections?",
          "questionIdA": "By empowering everyone to know their risk status for COVID and other diseases, the potential for the spread of unknown viruses will decrease considerably. Early detection will allow for people to self-isolate and take measures to heal from the virus faster. Meanwhile, nurses in developing countries can use the app to check if a patient has COVID, thus reducing the need to use expensive PCR test kits. People can also check themselves anytime they feel they have a COVID symptoms to confirm whether they need to go to the doctor for a check-up or test for COVID."

With supervision from Stanford medical advisors, we went through this process for two hospitals in South Asia and are currently in discussions with hospitals in South America and Africa.\nFor collecting directly from users, we spent significant efforts with pro bono expert lawyers to ensure compliance with data privacy laws, including LGPD.\nAs described in our <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/paper'>research paper</a>, some of the difficulties we found in processing data included excessive background noises and incorrect cough recordings submitted by users, which required the AI developers to manually clean the audio samples before training AI models."

We believe that rollout of the technology is just a matter of time and collaboration. As outlined in our research paper, we have independently shown that the COVID cough signature generalizes across continents and between clinical and crowdsourced datasets.\n\nWe have already done IRB-approved clinical studies in hospitals in two countries and are currently seeking approvals in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for clinical studies through private hospital executive and top-level governmental connections."

    "detectionCategory": "Technology",
    "distinguishableQ": "Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?",
    "distinguishableA": "Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 creates a unique respiratory signature in the throat and lungs that is distinct from other respiratory infections that produce a wet cough. Consequently, it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including CMU[8], MIT, and Cambridge. For example, a crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy (AUC = 0.7)[7]. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained a model to diagnose COVID-19 with a 89.1% accuracy.",
    "diagnosisQ": "How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?",
    "diagnosisA": "Based on this past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.",
    "performanceQ": "Will the performance of the AI model in different smartphones remain unaffected?",
    "performanceA": "Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions in the app that explain how to record their cough. However, we can use a technique called data augmentation to make the algorithm work in all types of scenarios if needed.",

      "distinguishableQ": "Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?",
      "distinguishableA": "Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 damages the throat and lungs, creating detectable differences in cough patterns. Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example,research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high acurracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.",
      "aiQ": "How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?",
      "aiA": "Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences."

Because COVID-19 creates a unique respiratory signature in the throat and lungs, distinct from respiratory infections that produce a wet cough, it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19. Though the differences may be subtle to the human ear, AI algorithms have shown promise in classifying cough sounds to identify various respiratory diseases including pertussis, asthma, and pneumonia by using various features extracted from audio waveforms, including MFCC coefficient, pitch, spectral energy, and zero crossing. Although the cough samples from various diseases sound similar, they each have a distinguishable pattern due to small differences in audio features, which AI algorithms are able to pick up on. Beyond COVID, it has been demonstrated that AI can classify certain diagnostic breath sounds, such as wheezing and rhonchi, from smartphone audio recordings.",
