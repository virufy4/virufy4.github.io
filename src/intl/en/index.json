    "distinguishableQ": "Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?",
    "distinguishableA": "Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 damages the throat and lungs, creating detectable differences in cough patterns. Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example,research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high acurracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.",
    "aiQ": "How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?",
    "aiA": "Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences."
